<H3>About</H3>
<p>This website is a database containing reviews of bootleg and knockoff games. I may throw in a ROMhack review every so often, as well. I made this website as a project for school, but it may evolve into something much more further down the line. Key word is "may". This website is useful because it aligns with my game hobbies, and strengthens my website building skills.</p>
