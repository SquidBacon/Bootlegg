<p>Super Mario 14 is… an interesting bootleg. For the most part, it is just Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 3 with a few things tweaked about them, like for example, Instead of a shockwave, you shoot fireballs out of Mario’s...staff? The enemies are changed to look like Koopas and Spinys from Super Mario Bros, but that’s where the problems begin with this bootleg. First of all, the game has numerous sprite issues, from the moonwalking Spinys to the Mario sprite randomly reverting to the KidNiki sprite midway through, which kinda shows that they cut corners quite a bit. This point is more aimed at the original game, but the levels are not at all designed to teach through gameplay, and you really have to press buttons and die a lot to understand the unique mechanics of the game. The enemies zerg rush you with little to no time to truly react to them before you get hit, or even die from tempura shrimp(by the way, that’s an actual enemy) Overall, this bootleg tried a little harder than most others that copied Mario’s head, but in this particular instance, I wouldn’t even recommend the original game.<br />

<p>This game gets three bootlegs, because while it tried a little harder to look original, it is plagued with overly aggressive enemy AI, horrid music, and controls that feel like depression.

OH SWEET MERCIFUL CHRIST, WHAT THE HECK IS THIS? Super Mario Land 4 is a platformer bootlegged from a Game Boy game based on an anime called Shin Chan. The original game doesn’t look great but at least it looks...playable. This bootleg is just plain awful. First of all, the level design is completely different from Crayon Shin Chan 4. You can barely tell what this game was based on. The sprite for Mario is completely original, but it takes sprites from many other Mario games, such as Donkey Kong on Game Boy, and one of the various Japan only games. The controls is where this bootleg really falls flat. Your jumping is delayed by about a second, and sometimes it doesn’t register at all. You can’t do the one thing that you would expect from a Mario game, which is defeating enemies by jumping on them. All you have is this really crummy projectile that travels across the ground, and you can’t shoot another one until one leaves the screen. Most enemies jump, or completely fly above you, so it makes this weapon pretty much pointless. Overall, the game is… pretty bad. It’s that kind of bootleg that you have to play yourself to truly understand. I’d give this game about five bootlegs.

This bootleg is one I hated at first, but I warmed up to it the second time playing. This is a ripoff of Jackie Chan’s Action Kung Fu, for the Nintendo Entertainment System(NES). You play as Mari(Cause that ain’t Mario, whatever it is), and you powerwalk through the land beating up anything in your path, including frogs, snakes, guys with swords, flying nunchaku, and more tempura shrimp(I’m sensing a pattern here). Mari controls slightly awkwardly, but that might just be because I’m using a keyboard,and the buttons that are supposed to simulate the A and B button are both switched and on opposite sides of the keyboard. You have a basic punch and a jump kick, among other assorted power ups. If you hold down the “B” button, you can charge and fire a Hadouken fireball, as if it were Street Fighter. The jumping controls aren’t too bad, but when you press down, you seem to fall faster. I don’t know if this has any use, so I’m kind of left wondering why the game even has this function. The game eventually throws you into an autoscrolling portion of the levels, where you cannot move on your own pace. The levels are also dotted with spikes and small platforms that require precision jumping and attacks to deal with the pigeons of death trying to kill you. I honestly think you should either make the whole level autoscroll, or none of it. Overall. This game is….actually not that bad. I think it’s the least terrible bootleg we’ve played so far, and the last Mario bootleg for now. I give this about 2 bootlegs.

  <H1>Sonic Classic Heroes</H1>
  <h3>
  
Console: Genesis Emulator 
  <br>
ROMhack of: Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and 2
  <br>
Creators of the hack: sonicretro.com users flamewing, ColinC10, and a whole bunch of other people
 <br>
  Release of hack: September 1, 2013, at its latest version

Don’t worry, before you downvote this entry, this is something that’s actually good. This time, I am reviewing Sonic Classic Heroes, a ROMhack(basically a modded classic game made by fans for other fans)of the first and second Sonic games, but with a twist. First thing you’ll notice is that you play as three characters at the same time, akin to Sonic Heroes, a game I may or may not talk about in the future. While you can play as another team of characters, I will only be focusing on Team Sonic this time, due to only playing the game as them. All characters have their abilities from Sonic 3, which include gliding, flying, flame dashing(don’t know what to call it), SWIMMING, and a few others. There is also one new ability in a golden shield that can allow Sonic to home in on enemies that are nearby, but is basically another shield for everyone else. While I like the first two Sonic games, I feel like they could have added Sonic 3 for a more complete adventure. I also think that playing as Sonic gets kinda pointless if Knuckles can glide, and Tails can swim. Knuckles especially breaks the game in the Sonic 1 portion due to his ability to glide. He picks up speed while doing so, so all you really have to do is go to a high area and start gliding to basically fly over the level. That means if you play as Knuckles, you can beat a vast majority of the first part of the whole hack in about 10 minutes. Tails can swim through the water levels in about five minutes, as well, so what exactly is the point of playing as Sonic? Not much. Apart from that, I think this is a solid hack. I’d give it about 4 ROMs. ROMs are like the moldy boots, except for ROMhacks. Hey, I had to rate this somehow.
