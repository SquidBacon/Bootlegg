<H1>Super Mario 14...ugh.</H1>

<p>Super Mario 14 is… an interesting bootleg. For the most part, it is just Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 3 with a few things tweaked about them, like for example, Instead of a shockwave, you shoot fireballs out of Mario’s...staff? The enemies are changed to look like Koopas and Spinys from Super Mario Bros, but that’s where the problems begin with this bootleg. First of all, the game has numerous sprite issues, from the moonwalking Spinys to the Mario sprite randomly reverting to the KidNiki sprite midway through, which kinda shows that they cut corners quite a bit. This point is more aimed at the original game, but the levels are not at all designed to teach through gameplay, and you really have to press buttons and die a lot to understand the unique mechanics of the game. The enemies zerg rush you with little to no time to truly react to them before you get hit, or even die from tempura shrimp(by the way, that’s an actual enemy) Overall, this bootleg tried a little harder than most others that copied Mario’s head, but in this particular instance, I wouldn’t even recommend the original game. This game gets 3 bootlegs.<br />
