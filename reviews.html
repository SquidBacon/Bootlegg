<p>Super Mario 14 is… an interesting bootleg. For the most part, it is just Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 3 with a few things tweaked about them, like for example, Instead of a shockwave, you shoot fireballs out of Mario’s...staff? The enemies are changed to look like Koopas and Spinys from Super Mario Bros, but that’s where the problems begin with this bootleg. First of all, the game has numerous sprite issues, from the moonwalking Spinys to the Mario sprite randomly reverting to the KidNiki sprite midway through, which kinda shows that they cut corners quite a bit. This point is more aimed at the original game, but the levels are not at all designed to teach through gameplay, and you really have to press buttons and die a lot to understand the unique mechanics of the game. The enemies zerg rush you with little to no time to truly react to them before you get hit, or even die from tempura shrimp(by the way, that’s an actual enemy) Overall, this bootleg tried a little harder than most others that copied Mario’s head, but in this particular instance, I wouldn’t even recommend the original game.<br />

<p>This game gets three bootlegs, because while it tried a little harder to look original, it is plagued with overly aggressive enemy AI, horrid music, and controls that feel like depression.

OH SWEET MERCIFUL CHRIST, WHAT THE HECK IS THIS? Super Mario Land 4 is a platformer bootlegged from a Game Boy game based on an anime called Shin Chan. The original game doesn’t look great but at least it looks...playable. This bootleg is just plain awful. First of all, the level design is completely different from Crayon Shin Chan 4. You can barely tell what this game was based on. The sprite for Mario is completely original, but it takes sprites from many other Mario games, such as Donkey Kong on Game Boy, and one of the various Japan only games. The controls is where this bootleg really falls flat. Your jumping is delayed by about a second, and sometimes it doesn’t register at all. You can’t do the one thing that you would expect from a Mario game, which is defeating enemies by jumping on them. All you have is this really crummy projectile that travels across the ground, and you can’t shoot another one until one leaves the screen. Most enemies jump, or completely fly above you, so it makes this weapon pretty much pointless. Overall, the game is… pretty bad. It’s that kind of bootleg that you have to play yourself to truly understand. I’d give this game about five bootlegs.
